# üõ†Ô∏è File Merger & Encryption Tool

This project is a file merger and encryption tool that combines two executable files into one using XOR encryption and embeds them into a stub. The stub is then compiled by a builder. When executed, the stub decrypts the two resources and extracts them to the disk location specified by the user in the builder options.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîê **XOR Encryption:** Converts two executable files into ciphertext by applying XOR encryption.
- üì¶ **Stub Resource Embedding:** The builder embeds two encrypted resources into the stub, which is compiled and executed later.
- üíæ **File Extraction:** The stub decrypts and drops the two files to a location of the user's choice.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Flexible Configuration:**
  - üëÅÔ∏è **HideFiles:** Option to hide the dropped files.
  - üóëÔ∏è **Self-Delete:** Automatically deletes the stub after it completes its task.
  - ü§ñ **High Mutation:** Obfuscation technique to make the code harder to analyze.
  - üéÉ **AMSI/ETW Patcher** Patch to prevent several functions from the amsi and ntdll library from working

## üìö Dependencies

To build this project, you need the following dependencies:

- **MetroFramework** - A .NET WinForms framework used for the UI.  
  [Download MetroFramework](https://github.com/thielj/MetroFramework)
  
- **dnlib** - A library to work with .NET assemblies for obfuscation purposes.  
  [Download dnlib](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib)

Make sure to install these libraries before building the project.

## üöÄ Usage

### Builder Configuration
1. Add the two executable files that you want to merge.
2. Select the options you need:
   - üëÅÔ∏è **HideFiles:** Hide the extracted files after dropping them.
   - üóëÔ∏è **Self-Delete:** Automatically delete the stub after execution.
   - ü§ñ **Obfuscate:** Apply basic obfuscation to the build file.
3. Compile the stub with the embedded encrypted-files.

### Execution
Once the stub is executed:
- It decrypts the embedded files.
- Extracts them to the specified disk location.
- Executes any optional features (hide files, self-delete).

# Advanced Binder & Crypter

A powerful file binder and crypter application for Windows with multiple features for executable management. This tool allows binding multiple files into a single executable with advanced encryption options.

## Features

- File binding capability (combine two executables into one)
- Single-file crypter mode (encrypt individual executables)
- Advanced polymorphic encryption for maximum FUD capability
- Custom stub settings for execution control
- Built-in file hiding functionality
- Self-removal options
- Randomized execution patterns

## Technical Details

The application uses a multi-layered approach to file encryption:
- Content-based key generation
- Dynamic block-based encryption
- Variable bit rotation and XOR operations
- Special handling for PE files to preserve header structures
- Multiple fallback decryption mechanisms
